				<h2 class="left">Data on efficacy of the most common vaccines</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/Efficacy.jpg" alt="How efficacy is calculated" class="imgfloat" id="img1">
					<p>
						The following data is from an article by Yale Medicine.
					</p>
					<p>
						First, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had a 91.3% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 cases from 7 days to 6 months after vaccination while being 100% effective against severe cases according to the CDC and 95.3% effective against severe cases according to the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Association (FDA). Although a study from the CDC in August showed decreasing efficacy against infection after some time, its effectiveness against severe cases remains high.
					</p>
					<p>
						Second, clinical data from Moderna showed that its vaccine had the same efficacy as Pfizer's at about 95% and will stay about the same six months after vaccination at 90% against infection and 95% against severe cases. Some studies also found that Moderna had higher efficacy in preventing symptomatic cases in health care workers and longer retention of initial efficacy compared to Pfizer's. However, more data is needed to differentiate the two.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine showed a 72% overall efficacy and 86% efficacy against moderate and severe cases in the U.S. based on analyses made by the FDA. Moreover, a company press release from Johnson & Johnson said that clinical trial data showed an increase in protection to 94% in moderate to severe cases after taking a booster shot two months after the initial dose.

				<h2 class="left">How the vaccine helped my mom fight against COVID</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/Woman vaccine.jpg" alt="Woman getting vaccinated" class="imgfloat" id="img2">
					<p>
						Last June 2020, when my mother was still not vaccinated, she tested positive for Covid-19 for the first time. Some symptoms she showed were high fever, loss of taste and smell, general weakness of the body, and labored breathing. As such, she became bedridden for quite a while. 
					</p> 
					<p>
						However, compared to the second time she tested positive for Covid-19 last September 2021, where she was fully vaccinated, most of her symptoms decreased in severity if not gone. Her fever was moderate, taste and smell remained, weakness was gone, and her breathing remained normal. Simply put, even though she still got infected while vaccinated, her case of infection was dramatically milder than when she was unvaccinated.c
					</p>
					<p>
						Although this may seem minor because my mom's symptoms weren't particularly life-threatening, those milder symptoms can be life-or-death for those with severe cases and in critical condition. By lessening the severity of symptoms an infected person will endure, the vaccine not only eases the strain on the person's body but also help maintain their mental health.
