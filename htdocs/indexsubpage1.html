					<p>
						To understand how vaccines help prevent diseases, we must first understand how our body's immune system responds to disease causing pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, each with a unique composition and antigen (part of the pathogen that induces the formation of antibodies).
					</p>
					<p>
						Whenever our immune system first encounters a pathogen, the former sends specific cells with the purpose of first, fighting off the pathogens, and second, collecting information 	about the pathogen's unique antigen and how to fight it. The body then uses the collected information to produce antibodies trained to recognize and fight that specific antigen. Once these antibodies are produced, the immune system stores this knowledge to help fight similar pathogens in the future.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, this process is not perfect as it takes time for the body to collect information and profuce antibodies. This makes pathogens new to the body especially dangerous as the body would be in a vulnerable state, trying to produce new antibodies. Problems also arise whenever a person's immune system is compromised, commonnly in babies and the elderly. This then begs the question, how do we prepare the body for the more dangerous pathogens? The answer to this would be vaccines.

					<p>
						Using the concept of the body's response to pathogens, vaccines prepare our bodies by trigering the process of antibody production. Vaccines do this by introducing a weakened version of the pathogen (sometimes inactive antigens) which the prompts response of the immune system. And since the introduced pathogen is weakened, it poses little threat to the body while still keepng the valuable information needed to produce antibodies. As such, the body will be prepared when the full strength vaccine comes.
					</p> 
					<p>
						However, not everyone can be vaccinated. Those with underlying health conditions or severe allergies may not be able to get vaccinated. How do we protect them you ask? Well this is where the concept of herd immunity come in.
					</p>
					<p>
						When majority of the people become vaccinated, what do you think will happen to the transmission of the pathogen? The pathogen will have less bodies to spread to limiting its 		transmission. This would also protect those unable to vaccinate as no one would be able to spread it to them basically making the whole population immune, thus the term herd immunity.
