				<h2 class="left">1. The ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/Vaccine ingredients.jpg" alt="Vials labelled Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer-BioNTech" class="imgfloat" id="img1">
					<p>
						First of all, nearly all the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are fats, sugars, and salts, ingredients found in many foods. Also pointed out by the CDC is the absence of preservatives, tissues, antibiotics, food proteins, medicines, latex, and metal in the vaccines. Second, the main ingredient in the vaccine that prevents us from getting sick is harmless as it only instructs our bodies how to respond to the virus. The contents of the vaccine are then discarded from the body after the latter has produced an immune response. As such, the vaccine is harmless and is safe to take. To access detailed ingredient lists, they are available at government websites like the DOH and the FDA.

				<h2 class="left">2. The natural immunity I get from being sick with COVID-19 is stronger than the vaccine's</h2>
				<article>

					<p>
						Although there is natural immunity gained from being infected by COVID-19 in the past, immunity acquired from vaccines causes a more predictable immune response as natural immunity's level of infection may vary depending on the severity of their illness, time since infection, and age. Vaccination is also safer, skipping the experience of being sick while still getting immunity. Furthermore, one study published in August 2021 showed that unvaccinated people who have had Covid-19 are two times more likely to get COVID-19 again than those fully vaccinated after recovery. Simply put, getting a vaccine provides a high level of protection and added protection alongside natural immunity from infection.

				<h2 class="left">3. The COVID-19 vaccines can affect a woman's fertility</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/Pregnant vaccine.png" alt="Woman getting vaccinated" class="imgfloat" id="img3">
					<p>
						According to the CDC, there is currently no evidence proving that any COVID-19 vaccine causes fertility problems in both men and women. Consequently, getting the vaccine is recommended for those pregnant to lower the risk of infection, as COVID-19 can seriously impact the pregnancy, endangering both the mother and the baby. Moreover, according to John Hopkins Medicine, this confusion started due to a false report on social media, mistaking spike proteins found on the virus to be the same as a spike protein related to pregnancy despite being different. The report then said that getting a COVID-19 vaccine would cause the body to attack the pregnancy-related spike proteins, affecting fertility. As the authenticity of the claim that started this myth was false, it is pretty safe to say the myth itself is not accurate.
