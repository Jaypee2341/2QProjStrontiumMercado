					<p>
						Despite COVID-19 vaccines being freely distributed all around the country, many 
						still refuse to get them. Some are misinformed, some are afraid of the side
						effects, and some question the effectiveness of the vaccine. With fake news and misinformation rampant throughout the internet, I've compiled some of the most vital information that can help you discern real from fake as well as help you decide whether to get the vaccine or not.
					</p>
					<p>
						To help showcase the information easier, it will be divided into 4 topics each focusing on an important aspect to understanding the vaccine. These 4 topics are:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The role of a vaccine in our body</li>
						<li>Studies on the vaccine and personal experiences</li>
						<li>Other diseases that have been almost eradicated vaccines</li>
						<li>Common myths and misconceptions about the Covid-19 vaccine</li>
					</ol>
